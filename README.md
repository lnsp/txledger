# txledger

This repository contains txledger, a piece of software crafted purely for learning purposes. It is a dead-simple implementation of a basic blockchain, excluding peer-to-peer support and other features.
It mainly focuses on security and the fundamental basics of how a blockchain works. Feels free to fork, add features and optimize.
